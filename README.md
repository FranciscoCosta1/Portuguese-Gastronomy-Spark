# Portuguese Gastronomy (Spark)

Academic Project for the course of Analyzing Big Data

Group: Francisco Costa, Jo√£o Gouveia, Pedro Rivera, Nuno Rocha

Technologies: <b>Spark, Python</b>.

In this 21st century, as we witness the transformation of the modern society into a digital world, tools are needed to leverage the use of data analytics and gather new insights to build an enriched experience to ones who enjoy the pleasure of this cuisine.

Objective: We aimed to analyze Portuguese gastronomy using Big Data technologies (Spark).

## Why Spark?
It enables a unified platform for: 
  * **(1) distributed storage and processing of tabular structures (DataFrames)**; 
  * **(2) the use of parallel processing of our natural language processing algorithm**; 
  * **(3) the integration of graph structures and algorithms**.
